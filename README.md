# Vehicle-Identification-Project
Vehicle Identification Project using CNN 

Vehicle Detection Image Set
This dataset is for machine learning process and computer vision steps.
Two labels:

Non-Vehicles
Vehicles
17760 image

# Conclusion
Here we find that the model works quite well with accuracy of 98.99% on training dataset and 99.62% on test dataset.
Thus this model is apt to identify the vehicles.
